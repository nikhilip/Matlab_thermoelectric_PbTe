This application is build using MATLAB R2024b. 

*****PbTe_Thermoelectric_Properties_BarrierHeight.exe*****: It is used for the evaluation of Thermoelectric Properties of PbTe nanaocomposite.It uses four input parameters namely Barrier Height which will be in a particular range, other parameters include the barrier width which will be in units of cm, next we have is the temperature and the carrier concentration. In order to get the TE properties w.r.t barrier height, the other three input parameters need to be constant(e.g Barrier Width-12e-7,Temp-300,Carrier Conc:5e21). The user can get the TE properties at a particular temperature and at the next interface users can plot or export the desired reults.
Users can also vary the temperature keeping the first window open and just vary the temperature and move to the next window and can export to the same excel file but gets same in different sheets.


*****PbTe_Thermoelectric_BarrierHeight.exe*****: It is used for the evaluation of Thermoelectric Properties of PbTe nanaocomposite with respect to variation in barrier width. The user can get the TE properties at a particular temperature, carrier concentration and barrier height and at the next interface users can plot or export the desired reults. Users can also vary the temperature keeping the first window open and just vary the temperature and move to the next window and can export to the same excel file but gets same in different sheets.


*****PbTe_Thermoelectric_Temperature.exe*****: It is used for the evaluation of Thermoelectric Properties of PbTe nanaocomposite with respect to variation in temperature.
The user can get the TE properties at a particular barrier width, carrier conc. and barrier height and at the next interface users can plot or export the desired reults.
Users can also vary the barrier width and height keeping the first window open and just vary the temperature and move to the next window and can export to the same excel file but gets same in different sheets.

*****PbTe_Optimization_ZT.exe*****: 
This application allows user to input the barrier height, temperature range, barrier width and carrier concentration.It gives the optimized value of barrier height that maximizes zT as a function of temperature, gives efficiency as a function of barrier height. The peak of the curve gives the optimized value of Barrier Height, which maximizes efficiency. gives the maximized zT values and zTmax can be achieved through filtering, as a function of temperature. The application also allows user to export and plot the results.

*****Maximum_ZT_Efficiency.exe*****:
The next part if the application allows user to obtain the zT values  by filtering through barrier height which gives maximum efficiency at all temperatures. It is a continuation from optimization step where the user can upload the excel file for efficiency and the application extracts the maximum efficiency and the optimim barrier height which can be futher use to obtain the zT values.
